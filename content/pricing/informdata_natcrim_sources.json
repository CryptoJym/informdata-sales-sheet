The three most common orders issued by NCUA include: (1) an Order to Cease and Desist, which requires a party to take action (or refrain from taking action), including making restitution; (2) an Order of Prohibition, which prohibits a party from ever working for a federally insured financial institution; and (3) an Order Assessing Civil Money Penalties. Prior to the issuance of an Administrative Order, the FCUA provides due process rights, which include the ability to have an administrative hearing before the Office of Financial Institution Adjudication, and to appeal the agency's decision to issue an order to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
