## Compliance quick notes

- **FCRA** governs all consumer reports (criminal, verifications, Essential Check). Follow adverse-action workflow.
- **DPPA / DOT** apply to MVR pulls—obtain driver consent and manage retention.
- **OIG/SAM & CMS**: healthcare providers must be screened monthly (Med Ex tiers cover this).
- **International** checks require GDPR/PIPEDA-compliant candidate releases.

For service-by-service compliance language, see the `compliance_notes` column inside `content/pricing/informdata_pricing_table.csv`.
