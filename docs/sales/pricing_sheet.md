# InformData Pricing Reference

**Generated:** 2025-10-30

## How to read this sheet
- **InformData Cost** – direct vendor charge for the single service shown.
- **Automation Spend** – internal automation/AI effort we allocate (currently only the Essential Check bundle carries a $1 automation charge).
- **Platform Overhead** – optional hosting/orchestration spend layered on top of automation (defaults to $0 until we assign real infrastructure costs).
- **Total Cost to Vuplicity** – InformData cost + automation spend + platform overhead (plus any pass-through amounts). This is not customer price; it shows where we break even.
- **Recommended Price** – suggested sell price after comparing public MSRPs and preserving margin. Adjust per deal as needed.
- **Competitor MSRP** – public pricing gathered from Checkr and GoodHire as of October 30, 2025.citeturn0search0turn1search1
