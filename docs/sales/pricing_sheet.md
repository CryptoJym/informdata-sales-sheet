# InformData Pricing Reference

**Generated:** 2025-10-30

## How to read this sheet
- **InformData Cost** – direct vendor charge for the specific InformData service.
- **Booplicity Automation (USD)** – estimated incremental AI/decisioning cost we incur to process the result (≈$0.03 for most services, ≈$0.20 for county-level court checks, ≈$0.34 for the Essential bundle).
- **Booplicity Platform (USD)** – shared hosting/orchestration spend allocated per search (~$0.25 each run) so Sales can see the true all-in delivery cost.
- **Total Cost to Booplicity** – sum of vendor + automation + platform inputs (plus any pass-through fees). This is our break-even, not customer-facing pricing.
- **Recommended Price / Margin** – suggested sell price and contribution after the above costs based on current public MSRPs. Adjust per deal as needed.
- **Competitor MSRP** – public pricing gathered from Checkr and GoodHire as of October 30, 2025.citeturn0search0turn1search1

## Quick callouts
- **County civil searches** now reflect ~$0.20 AI review + $0.25 platform overhead, putting Booplicity total cost at **$4.70** versus Checkr’s $40 MSRP—ample room for margin while covering automation.
- **MVR & CDLIS pulls** carry ~$0.28 of internal cost (automation + platform) on top of InformData’s $2.95, yielding an all-in Booplicity cost of **$3.23** against Checkr’s $9.50 / $14.50 price points.citeturn0search0
- **Essential Check bundle** totals **$2.24** (vendor + ~$0.34 internal) while Checkr Basic+ remains $29.99; we can still quote $28.49 and keep ~$26 contribution after automation/hosting.citeturn0search0
- **Healthcare sanctions (Med Ex tiers)** land between **$2.18–$2.45** all-in, leaving ~$3+ room relative to GoodHire’s $5.99 published rate.citeturn1search1
- **Continuous monitoring** stays pass-through at **$1.25** (no internal adder) so we can mirror competitor MSRP and position the value on unified alerting.
